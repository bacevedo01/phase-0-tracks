  <!-- What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? 
  To standardize common elements like headers/footers/articles for clearly readable code. You can look at any page and understand the underlying structure and organization.

  Which ones do you see as most useful? 
  Header/Footer/Nav/Aside/Section

  What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
  They will display from top to bottom.

  What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge?
  I learned how to create my own shortcuts for snippets of code in sublime.

  Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
  Absolutely, short cuts are awesome.

  What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? 
  The snippet portion was challenging at first.

  How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
  By practice and creating snippets on my own.
